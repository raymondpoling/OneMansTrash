Week 6 Weekend Homework
Create an application for Buy and Sell - like craigslist. That allows users to upload
 products for sale and also allow users to bid on items(just a click and numbBids++).
  Where numbids will be stored in the firebase realtime database. The application
  should be login based and should also be implemented in MVVM.

- MVVM architecture
- Repository Pattern
- LiveData
- Firebase Realtime Database
- Firebase Authentication
- Images associated with products -> use the FileProvider in android
